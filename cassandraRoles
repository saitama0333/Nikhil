your roles and responsibilities will be
1) Cassandra node
2) cluster set up (standalone and cluster) 
3) Schema creation as well
4) cluster maintenance​
5) like data backup
6) nodetool clean up
7) db snapshot
8) cluster status and health monitoring..

 for Kafka same think will be applicable
along with that topic creation and maintenance​
 for example
assume we have 10 nodes in a cluster
this is suffice for normal traffic
in case we have high traffic
that time we can add extra nodes in cluster
for data balance across all nodes and to clean garbage (tombstones)

tombstone --> garbage value, every delete goes here-- tombstone is specific data stored alongside standard data.---it has built-in expiration date/time--and cleared during cassandra compaction
 
we need to run nodetool clean up and compaction
these things are cluster manintance
also
data will be written in mem cache first
these values can be synced to disk using nodetool
these related activites as are comes cluster management
basically
our cluster should be always neat and clean
for this purpose we need to be use some commands from noodetool
just read description of nodetool commands
that will be given enough knowledge to u

compact --> merging multiple SSTables into a single new one

cleanup -->  to remove unwanted data after adding a new node to the cluster. Cassandra does not automatically remove data from nodes that lose part of their partition range to a newly added node



drain
these commands are important
you already know more about Cassandra
 when comparing other peeps
so nothing to worry
take Datastax cassandra documentation.
that will give u enough info
for u nodetool is important


SSTable --> is a  Storage Format

kafka -- it is publish/subscribe messaging system ---To handle realtime data feeds, high thorughput high volume of data
	-real time processing of this high data feeds
	
-	data(messages) is stored in topics
-	topics are split into partitions which is later replicated( for HA and fault-tolerant)


partition ---reduces latency and increases performance.---done parallely---topics are divided into multiple partitions

replication --each partition can have multiple replicas, stored on a different broker.

java Heap space is used by java runtime to allocate memory
