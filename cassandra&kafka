we follow guidelines from datastax(cassandra) for Production systems or other changes which the developer suggests

1) commit log:
commit log uses sequential write
biggest performance gain for write is to put commit log in a separate disk drive
IO provisioned
cassandra.yaml


*****performance:****
1)sync clocks 
Datastax rewrites a column only if there is another version whose timestamp is more recent

2)tcp settings

prevent connection timeout
	/etc/sysctl.conf
net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time=60 
net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_probes=3 
net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_intvl=10


Apache Cassandra is a distributed database management system. Large amounts of data can be spread across a cluster of hundreds of nodes
probe constantly monitors the internal performance and resource usage throughout a node in a Cassandra cluster

To the handle thousands of concurrent connections used by the database, change these Linux kernel settings:
/etc/sysctl.conf
sysctl -p --> reload sysctl settings

net.core.rmem_max=16777216 
net.core.wmem_max=16777216 
net.core.rmem_default=16777216 
net.core.wmem_default=16777216 
net.core.optmem_max=40960 
net.ipv4.tcp_rmem=4096 87380 16777216 
net.ipv4.tcp_wmem=4096 65536 16777216



/etc/security/limits.conf file:
<cassandra_user> - memlock unlimited
<cassandra_user> - nofile 100000

$ cat /proc/pid/limits

JMX is a Java technology that supplies tools for managing and monitoring Java applications and services


listen_address
    Default: localhost The IP address or hostname that the database binds to for connecting this node to other nodes.
Warning:

    Never set listen_address to 0.0.0.0.
    Do not set values for both listen_address and listen_interface on the same node

clearing cassandra data:
$ sudo rm -rf /var/lib/cassandra/*
